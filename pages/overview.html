      <p>Picture a canvas painted with the hues of human progress, a masterpiece in perpetual evolution. Imagine cities that rise like gleaming monuments to ingenuity and unity. Skyscrapers that touch the heavens, adorned not only with steel and glass but with vertical gardens that breathe life into concrete jungles: the positivist utopia of science-fiction. Rooftop terraces become oases of calm amidst the hustle, where people gather to reconnect with nature and each other, a delicate balance struck between urbanity and the untamed world. Envision homes that cocoon us in comfort while embracing the Earth's whispers. Walls that breathe, capturing sunlight and wind to power our spaces. The boundary between indoors and outdoors blurs as homes become extensions of the natural world. Our world, however, is far from the technological and ecological perfective balance of resources and commodities.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In the future city, social movements would be obsolete, and there would be no power struggle between the privileged and the marginalized, who often bear the brunt of our relentless pursuit of economic expansion.  Yet, challenges persist. Income inequality casts shadows over the gleaming skyscrapers, with some communities reaping the benefits of progress more than others. The struggle for affordable housing remains a pressing issue, and not all citizens have equal access to the city's green spaces and technological innovations.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In this vision of the future, the city is a dynamic tapestry of progress and potential, where human ingenuity and environmental consciousness coexist. But the canvas is not yet complete; it is a work in progress, a reflection of our ongoing efforts to balance the demands of urban life with the preservation of our planet's health and the equitable well-being of all its inhabitants.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>In this utopian future, our need for water in the gardens is deeply symbolic and profound. Water, a timeless force, has over eons etched its mark on the Earth, sculpting canyons and valleys that define the very landscape upon which our cities now flourish. Water serves as more than a mere physical necessity; it is the elixir that satiates not only our bodily thirst but also our yearning for connection – a reminder of the unbreakable bond we share with the natural world.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Throughout history, humanity has converged by rivers, lakes, and oceans, drawn to these aquatic realms by an inexplicable allure. Here, we have woven the fabric of our stories, celebrated age-old rituals, and erected cities that stand as monuments to the mesmerizing charm of waterside living. Civilizations have thrived in close proximity to these lifelines, with magnificent cities rising to glory and, eventually, yielding to the sands of time. Yet, through it all, the rivers persist, flowing steadfastly, bearing the timeless wisdom they have carried for millennia.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Consider the Nile, cradle of ancient knowledge, where the pages of history are written in the silt-laden currents. Or the Ganges, whose sacred waters cradle the spiritual aspirations of millions. It is within the gentle embrace of these waters that culture takes shape, traditions are born, and the boundless canvas for human creativity unfurls.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In this future, as we tend to our gardens, we are not merely nurturing plants; we are embracing a profound connection to the flow of existence itself. We recognize that the lessons of the waterside endure, reminding us of our shared past and guiding us toward a future where the harmony between our cities and the natural world flourishes, just as civilizations have thrived along the banks of these eternal rivers.</p>

      <p>This study draws its inspiration from a prior project I published on Datacamp, which delved into the dynamics of the real estate market in Paris. That project can be referenced <a style="text-decoration:none" href="https://app.datacamp.com/workspace/w/c88e5476-bb2c-466d-ab4a-8b763bab1508/editand">here</a>.  Notably, it highlighted that approximately 10% of property prices in Paris are influenced by their proximity to trees and green spaces. This observation serves as a foundation for exploring the potential implications of climate change on cities, particularly by considering an extreme projection: that by the year 2050, Paris could experience a climate similar to that of Marrakech.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In this speculative scenario, often referred to as the "21st arrondissement", the study aims to envision what Marrakech might be like in 2050. It poses questions about the potential transformation of the city.  Who will live there? How will expensive will real estate be? And what will emerge as the key factors driving property prices?</p>
      <br>
      <p>In essence, this study seeks to extrapolate from the study on Paris real estate insights to create a speculative but thought-provoking narrative about Morocco’s future. By doing so, it hopes to shed light on the broader implications of climate change on urban development, real estate markets, and the dynamics of livable cities.</p>

      <p>This project is the result of a research grant generously provided by the Fulbright commission, specifically the Fulbright-Hays Faculty Research Abroad Grant. At its core, this research is centered around the examination of human mobility within the country of Morocco. Importantly, it transcends the narrow confines of merely studying sub-Saharan migration patterns or the movement of Moroccans to Europe. Instead, it seeks to illuminate a lesser-explored facet of Moroccan society: the lives of ordinary middle-class Moroccans in the 21st century and the significant demographic shifts that have catalyzed extensive population movements throughout the country.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As we alluded to in our introduction, this study is fundamentally about the intersection of water and people. However, it is much more than that. It serves as a testament to the multifaceted nature of this research, touching on various aspects of Moroccan life and society. It delves into the lives of individuals who fall within the broad spectrum of neither impoverished nor affluent, neither enduring extreme hardship nor living in opulence. These individuals represent the heart of middle-class Morocco, and their experiences in this era of the 21st century have contributed to a notable transformation marked by widespread population movements.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In the grander context, this study encompasses a tapestry of themes and narratives. It is a story of not just demographics but also of the human condition. As the research unfolded, it became apparent that it was about far more than initially envisioned. It evolved into a narrative that encapsulates the essence of the human experience itself, illustrating the intricate ways in which people and their surroundings intertwine and evolve in response to changing circumstances.</p>

      <p>To start, let's take a closer look at Morocco by considering its geographical features. The locals frequently characterize their country as a 'cold country under the sun,' which is a phrase that encapsulates the striking variety of bioclimate zones found within its borders. When one takes to the skies and observes the African continent from above, the continent begins to take shape: as you journey southward, the elevation becomes more prominent. However, nestled at the heart of the continent lies a substantial expanse dominated by savannahs, wetlands, and deserts.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In a broader context, Africa as a whole boasts extensive stretches of relatively uniform topography, which facilitates ease of travel and exploration across the continent.  Relative flatness of terrain is a noteworthy feature of the African landscape around the Sahara region.  </p>
      <br>
      <p>Over the course of centuries, these vast and varied landscapes have been traversed, inhabited, and shaped by different cultures and peoples. Among them, Arabs and their Tamazight brethren have played a prominent role. They have ventured across Africa's challenging desert expanses, sought refuge in its nurturing oases, and set sail from its port to the world beyond. This enduring history of interaction and movement across the African terrain has contributed to the rich tapestry of cultures and influences that define the continent's identity, as well as the Morocco’s identity.</p>

      <p>Indeed, Morocco has a rich history as a crossroads between different worlds. This description highlights its pivotal geographical location, where various cultures, trade routes, and influences have converged and interacted over the ages. It has been a melting pot of civilizations.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This historical and geographical significance sets the stage for a deeper exploration of Morocco's diverse landscapes and their profound impact on the country's distinctive cultural and environmental dynamics. By delving into the specific characteristics of Morocco's terrain, we can better understand how these landscapes have shaped its society, culture, and way of life, as well as how they continue to play a vital role in its contemporary identity.</p>
      <br>
      <p>However, it's important to recognize that this study goes beyond a mere examination of landscape. It encompasses the complex interplay of urban and rural identities, which can sometimes be in conflict with each other. These urban and rural identities are integral aspects of the societal fabric and dynamics being explored in this research.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>Morocco's uniqueness is deeply rooted in its mountainous landscape, which sets it apart as the most elevated country to the north of the Sahara desert. To illustrate this geographical feature, a detailed terrain rendering was created by combining Landsat raster files and editing them with Aerialod software. This rendering vividly depicts the juxtaposition of high elevations against the coastal regions.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The significance of these mountains becomes especially apparent as moist air from the sea sweeps along the coastline. When this moist air encounters the imposing barrier of the Atlas mountains, it undergoes a transformative process. The mountains serve as channels, forcing the air to ascend in elevation. As the air rises, it cools, causing moisture to condense and fall in the form of rainfall.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This intricate interplay between the mountains and the atmosphere bestows upon Morocco's semi-arid climate its most precious gift: rain. Rainfall, resulting from this delicate interaction, is invaluable to the region, sustaining ecosystems, agriculture, and the livelihoods of the people who call this diverse and dynamic country home.</p>

      <p>Rain serves as the lifeblood that nurtures ecosystems, sustains agriculture, and satiates the thirst of communities in Morocco. This harmonious collaboration between land and sea, elevated mountains and coastal regions, has played a pivotal role in forging Morocco's unique identity. The landscape itself becomes a storyteller, conveying how the convergence of natural elements shapes a nation's character. It illustrates how geography and atmospheric interactions intricately mold every facet of everyday life. Morocco's identity is intimately linked with the dynamic interplay of its environment, making it a compelling case study of how nature and civilization coexist and shape each other.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The overarching objective of this project revolves around understanding the dynamics of human populations.  It is about latitudes and people, latitudes without people, latitudes with disappearing people.  This endeavor employs data-driven approaches to delve into the intricate landscape of human mobility within the nation of Morocco. It seeks to unravel not only the driving forces that dictate the nature and frequency of this mobility but also the profound impacts it has on the daily lives and cultural traditions of the Moroccan people, especially through the lens of social remittance.</p>

      <p>Why consider parallels? Parallel lives? Parallel mountain ranges? These questions form the intriguing backdrop for our study of Morocco's population mobility.  The migration of human populations is not a recent phenomenon; rather, it is a fundamental aspect of human history and an essential part of the human experience.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Parallel lives – a notion that suggests those living along the same latitude may share more similarities than differences, and that as we travel from parallel to parallel, there is a fundamental change in the human experience. It's a hypothesis that invites us to explore whether geographic lines could, in fact, trace cultural and environmental parallels across the diverse landscape of Morocco.</p>
      <br>
      <p>And what about parallel mountain ranges? The thought lingers, beckoning us to discover whether these majestic geological formations, too, might align along these lines of latitude, offering insights into the country's geological history, a geology that has forged culture, identity and ethnicity, and also lies at the core of Morocco’s current changing values as the renewable water resources from aquifers are slowly depleted.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Our research methodology takes its cue from the patterns of human migrations etched into Morocco's past and present. Like a time-traveling journey, we will traverse this nation from its southern reaches to its northern expanse, unfurling the pages of history as we go, pages that give us insight into the lives of Morocco’s mobile population today.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>Starting at the 20th parallel, we'll embark on a journey through Morocco's southern landscapes, where the Sahara's golden sands meet ancient oases and vibrant desert cultures. As we move northward, we'll cross each degree of latitude, mirroring the footprints of those who ventured across this land centuries ago.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Our expedition culminates at the 36th parallel in the north, beyond Morocco's Atlas Mountains, fertile Andalusian plains, and the bustling cities of the Mediterranean coast, ending somewhere in the middle of the sea.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As we cross each latitude, we will aim to uncover the stories, cultures, and histories that have shaped Morocco's regions. This method promises to reveal the secrets hidden within the very lines of latitude that crisscross this nation, providing a unique lens through which to explore Morocco's past and present demographic trends.</p>
      <br>
      <p>It's interesting that, while most people on our planet reside between the 20th and the 30th degree parallels north, Morocco presents a unique contrast. The demographic trend here is a shift from the southern regions towards the area located above the 33rd parallel, home to the country's metropolis, Casablanca. The majority of the country's population is concentrated within this narrow range of just three degrees of latitude.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This expedition is centered around exploring different latitudes, sometimes along the coastline, at other times venturing inland, but always moving north.</p>
