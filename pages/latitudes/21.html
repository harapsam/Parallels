      <p>21 degrees 20 seconds north is a line drawn in the sand, a vestige of Western pragmatic linearity that once exerted its power here, creating neatly interlocking countries that fit together like pieces in a diplomatic puzzle. This parallel serves as the border between Western Sahara and Mauritania, with a portion of Western Sahara under the control of the Polisario Front for the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, which has never been recognized as an independent country. It was an easy line to draw. It didn't divide communities, there was nothing to really 'go around', but it did cut off the nomadic Sahrawi people from their ancestral routes, a disruption that likely went unnoticed, given the sparse population of the region.  Where did everyone go?  Or was it always this empty?</p>

      <p>What is Western Sahara? Is it a country, a disputed region, or part of Morocco? It all depends on who you ask. In 2020, Trump officially recognized Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, and it became one of the conditions for Morocco's acceptance of the Abraham Accords. But more importantly, who makes up Western Sahara's population? With an average population density, it is the second least populated territory in the world. Approximately 50% of the region's population resides in the capital, Laayoune, while Dakhla serves as another densely populated urban center. Both of these cities significantly skew the mean population density, boasting a population density of over 16,000. However, out in the bottom right corner at 21 degrees 20 minutes north, there are hardly any inhabitants, if any at all.</p>

      <p>The GIF shown here demonstrates just how deserted the area is. It was created using weighted population density files for every year from 2000 to 2020, configured in QGIS. A screenshot was taken for each year and then combined to create this short GIF. The darker the blue, the less inhabited the area is. The green areas represent moderately populated regions, although their density is still relatively low compared to the overall population, often less than one. As we reach the urban centers, the map transitions to yellow or orange. Without a doubt, over the course of a twenty-year period, we can observe population migrations from the borders of waterways, which are represented by the green areas in the south that resemble river valleys. By 2020, these population centers in the south have all dried up. In the bottom right corner, however, there is no change in population density because there is no one there, not even at the beginning. There is another neatly shaped corner above that one, which is also empty. So, where did everyone go?</p>

      <p>Morocco does indeed have administrative control over much of Western Sahara. However, a border known as the Berm runs from the top right of the map to the bottom left; it serves as a demarcation between Moroccan sovereignty and the territory claimed by the Polisario Front, which aspires to establish the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. The Polisario Front administers a region with a remarkably low population. Western Sahara is sparsely populated, and given that the vast majority of its inhabitants live in coastal cities, the area that would constitute the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic is the least densely populated place on Earth, excluding Antarctica.  The following map shows the Berm, which marks the border through the eastern side of Western Sahara. If we compare this border map with our GIF showing changes in population density over a twenty-year period, we can see that the area with the fewest people is indeed the region controlled by the Polisario Front.</p>

      <p>Embrace your intuition, and you might conclude that coastal living, with its abundant seafood and livelihoods derived from fishing, is inherently more comfortable. Conversely, you may believe that arid regions naturally harbor fewer residents. To challenge this notion, let's embark on a journey of exploration into comparative population densities within this region. Our voyage continues with following two maps.  The first map, crafted using QGIS, unveils the puzzle-piece political borders of the nations that define this territory. As our quest continues, we turn to the second map, also crafted in QGIS, illuminating the population density within these very nations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>Even without the guiding lines of political borders on our map, the demarcation of nations becomes strikingly evident through the population density data, most notably in the expanse of Algeria bordering Western Sahara and Mauritania. In this very region lies the Tindouf refugee camp, a sanctuary for approximately 100,000 displaced Sahrawi souls, situated at the coordinates 27째41'00" north. Tindouf stands as a tiny sun-baked town amidst the unforgiving arid expanse of the Hammada plateau, perched on the precipice of the Sahara, often referred to as the Devil's Garden. It's a journey of roughly 500 kilometers from our initial starting point, a journey marked by significant yet enduring displacement.</p>

        In the maps above, the dark blue, vacant areas are all within Polisario-controlled Western Sahara. Even the population of Mauritania's northern province is squeezed right up against the border of a lifeless desert. This void speaks volumes about people through their conspicuous absence. Where have these individuals gone? The subsequent graph crafted with Seaborn depicts the distribution of displaced Sahrawis, based on data established by the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees). Tindouf hosts the largest population of displaced Sahrawis, while another substantial group resides in the Moroccan-controlled region of Western Sahara. Nearly three-quarters of the population have settled within the region, a place that is their current abode but not necessarily their true home.  They are home, yet not home.</p>

      <p>In terms of absolute numbers, the displaced Sahrawis may not be numerous, yet their absence leaves a pronounced void in the heart of the Sahara. However, these numbers seem to conceal something deeper, something that goes beyond mere statistics. For a more comprehensive understanding, we can turn to the wealth of data provided by the Missing Migrants Project, which meticulously documents individuals from around the world who have lost their lives while on the move.  The subsequent map zeroes in on the western coastline of Africa, spanning from Mauritania to Morocco. The size of each circle corresponds to the number of lives tragically lost at that specific location. As this visual representation of data illustrates, the coast of Western Sahara emerges as a significant hub of maritime migration.  Many never make it to their final destination.</p>
