        <p>Traveling 400 kilometers northward from Dakhla along the coast, we reach Western Sahara's largest urban hub, Laayoune. Surprisingly, Laayoune differs significantly from Dakhla. Contrary to what we have seen until now, it's not situated on a peninsula. Instead, Laayoune is nestled 16 kilometers inland, alongside the banks of a sheltered desert oasis. Its survival hinges on irrigation from an often precarious water system.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Nevertheless, Laayoune surpasses Dakhla in size and offers more in almost every aspect: a larger population, more sea, more land, and even a greater number of ships, despite the distance of the town from the sea. To underscore Laayoune's regional significance, consider the population distribution in Western Sahara as illustrated in the accompanying graph. Notably, Laayoune, Dakhla and Boujdour are coastal cities, whereas Samara lies 180 kilometers inland. Impressively, approximately three-fourths of the entire population reside in just four urban centers.</p>

          Now, let's delve into the vibrant maritime scene of Laayoune. The city is in the midst of constructing a brand-new port, a project with a staggering price tag of $500 million. This monumental investment underscores the city's strategic significance, even though the port won't cater to commercial fishing needs.</p>
          <br>
        <p>Speaking of fishing, Laayoune boasts an impressive fleet of registered fishing vessels at its harbor. As we glance at the graph below configured using data available at MarineTraffic, it becomes evident that the majority of Western Sahara's maritime vessels find their home in Laayoune. This maritime hub reigns supreme in ship registrations, despite the bustling fishing activity observed around Dakhla and south of the Dakhla Peninsula.

      <p>Indeed, Laayoune is quite expansive, and you might be inclined to think that. It's absolutely accurate that one thing Laayoune has in abundance is land — vast expanses of it. This city is ensconced within the embrace of a picturesque Saharan oasis, where small agricultural plots thrive thanks to meticulous irrigation practices.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Shifting our focus towards the realm of real estate, we unearth an intriguing pattern that closely mirrors what we previously observed in Dakhla. It's worth noting that the accompanying bar chart provides a vivid illustration of the substantial prevalence of vacant land listings within the real estate market, surpassing other property types by a significant margin.  But what does this trend signify for the urban centers of Western Sahara? This phenomenon of abundant land listings in urban areas points to a larger narrative, one characterized by a dynamic and mobile population undergoing a transformative process of rural-to-urban migration. It's a testament to the region's evolving landscape, with people from inland areas making their way into these urban hubs, redefining the socio-economic fabric of the region in the process.</p>

      <p>Upon first setting our eyes upon Laayoune, it's easy to conjure images of vast expanses of cultivated fields and lush palm groves enveloping the cityscape and its surroundings, citrus trees bordering a path to a lake surrounded by golden dunes. To a certain extent, this imagery holds true; the banner image of this latitude is of Laayoune. The need to accommodate a constantly shifting and mobile population presents a unique challenge. Given the limitations of the narrow Dakhla Peninsula, alternative development areas must be sought.  Why not Laayoune?</p>
      <br>
      <p>In light of this imperative, we turn our attention to the fertile oases dotting the 266,000 square kilometers of Western Sahara. The following pie chart provides a compelling visual representation of the proportion of arable land encircling Laayoune in comparison to all other oases scattered throughout the region. Astonishingly, over one-third of the arable land in Western Sahara lies within and around the vicinity of Laayoune. This constitutes a truly significant expanse, shaping the region's agricultural and urban landscape in a substantial manner.</p>

        <p>Employing the same methodology used to scrutinize Dakhla's urban landscape, let's turn our analytical lens toward Laayoune. To gather this valuable data, I crafted a web scraper programmed to collect comprehensive information regarding available land for sale in the vicinity of Laayoune. Subsequently, by leveraging shapefiles depicting the built environment, conveniently sourced from the United Nations database, and employing precise calculations of building footprints, we can discern the breakdown of land utilization within a 100-kilometer radius encompassing the city.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Upon initial inspection, the percentages presented on the graph may appear modest when compared to the figures observed in Dakhla. However, it's essential to note that the following pie chart forecasts a remarkable upswing in the built environment—a projected 70% increase in the near future. This imminent transformation underscores the dynamic nature of Laayoune's urban development, signifying a significant shift in its spatial landscape and its projected population growth.</p>

        <p>While the prospects may appear enticing, let's embark on an alternative journey to visualize the stark climatic realities of this region. Below, observe the graph that artfully depicts the stark contrast between the expanses of arable oases and the vast deserts. No words are necessary; the slender green sliver extending to the right poignantly illustrates the extent of oasis land. In the grand scheme of Western Sahara's landscape, it becomes astonishingly evident that the arid desert blankets over 99% of the terrain, vividly portraying the region's predominantly harsh and arid climate.</p>

        <p>Nonetheless, this does not imply that endeavors to bolster agricultural production are dormant. As we've already observed, the exportation of fruits and vegetables has emerged as a pivotal component of the Moroccan economy. Furthermore, the prolonged growing season along the fringes of the Sahara bestows Western Sahara with a distinct edge in the marketplace.  Illustrating this agricultural innovation, the image below offers glimpses of crop experimentation taking place in the vicinity of Laayoune. It serves as a tangible representation of the region's determination to transform arid landscapes into thriving fields and underscores its potential to harness the extended growing season on the Sahara's border—an impressive testament to human adaptability and the capacity to prosper amidst challenging environments.</p>

        <p>In summary, when we broach the subject of land in Western Sahara, we delve deeper than mere surface area; we venture beneath the earth's crust. In the case of Laayoune's urban expansion, the primary objective isn't to cultivate fields but rather to lay the foundation for progress. While it's true that accommodating the transient populations plays a role, the primary impetus revolves around stimulating economic growth.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Approximately 116 kilometers to the southeast of Laayoune lies the crucial phosphate mine of Bu Craa. The colossal investment of $500 million in Laayoune's new port finds its purpose in facilitating the efficient loading of phosphates onto awaiting ships. It's worth noting that despite Bu Craa's remote location, it lays claim to the world's longest conveyor belt, stretching an astonishing 120 kilometers from the heart of the mine to the coastal depot. This extraordinary infrastructure represents a linchpin of the regional economy, underscoring its pivotal role in sustaining livelihoods.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On a global scale, Morocco has established itself as the second-largest exporter of phosphates, yielding only to China. The accompanying pie chart succinctly illustrates Morocco's significant market share in the global phosphate export arena, further exemplifying the nation's integral role in this critical industry.  Land in Western Sahara transcends romanticized depictions of timeless oasis villages frozen in history.  Land in Laayoune is a very serious matter.</p>
