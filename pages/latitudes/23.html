      <p>Now that we know where the people have gone, let's journey over there and see what's happening. At 23 degrees 29 minutes north on the coastline, we find ourselves in Dakhla, a well-developed urban center in Morocco situated in the middle of the Western Saharan coastline. Dakhla is a delicate balance between opposing worlds - a convergence of land and sea, a dance between hot and cold.  First and foremost, let's examine its geographical features. The following image is sourced from Google Earth, and allows us to pinpoint the town of Dakhla on a map. The town is also situated at the tip of a slender peninsula that extends from the western coast of Africa, just like La Gouira. In total, this peninsula covers an area of 70 square kilometers. It's a rather snug fit indeed.</p>

      <p>Although the indigenous inhabitants of Western Sahara, the Sahrawis, have a nomadic tradition, in a postcolonial world, the allure of the sea appears to be quite compelling for them. Given the region's narrow strip of land, the sea assumes a paramount role in sustaining life in the region due to its abundant natural resources. European Union member nations have long exploited these resources in Western Sahara, which has sparked resentment among the Sahrawis.  
        
      In 1976, after leaving the region, Spain granted Morocco military and administrative control in exchange for fishing rights. More recently, France has facilitated negotiations with Morocco to permit industrial fishing ships from France to operate in these waters. Despite the Sahrawis' appeals to the European Union, which imposed an embargo on Moroccan fishing agreements with other nations in the rich coastal waters, this embargo goes largely unenforced.  Royal pressure from Morocco is designed to keep agricultural and fishing trade with Europe flowing.</p>

    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>The data presented on the following two maps is sourced from GeoTiff files available at MarineTraffic, illustrating the density of fishing ships along the west coast of Africa. The maps are styled in QGIS.  It's astonishing to observe the high concentration of ships off the coast of Western Sahara, particularly in and around Dakhla and the port at La Gouira. Remarkably, these vessels are only engaged in fishing activities and do not include commercial or cargo ships.

      The first map illustrates fishing ships operating in the waters off the coast of West Africa. The noticeable high concentration of ships, represented in yellow, can be observed primarily at the southern end of the map, where they are entering and departing from ports along the Nouadhibou Peninsula, which is where we initiated our journey. It's worth noting that as we progress up the coast and approach the Mediterranean, the number of ships gradually decreases, with almost none present by the time we reach Tangiers.

      The second map provides a closer look at Dakhla, showcasing the considerable intensity of the fishing sector around the town.

      <p>Separated between two worlds, Dakhla strikes an intriguing balance between land and sea. If you're struggling to find the perfect place to settle or an appealing piece of land in such a restrained area, you can always give your sea legs a try. Dakhla boasts a bustling port, a fact supported by data on port activity and naval fleets provided by the Moroccan government. The pie chart displayed here illustrates the relative number of ships registered at 24 ports around the country. It's worth noting that both Agadir and Laayoune are considerably larger urban areas compared to Dakhla. Given Dakhla's narrow strip of land and relatively small population of 100,000, it exhibits an impressively high ship density in contrast to other ports. This phenomenon is vividly evident in the GeoTiff files depicting the density of fishing ships in the images we saw above.</p>

      <p>Dakhla may be a narrow peninsula jutting into the sea, but despite its relatively small surface area, it is densely populated and surrounded by a sea teeming with intense commercial fishing activity. Many of the region's inhabitants have chosen to settle here, akin to other coastal cities. But what draws them here? What opportunities exist, and how can one thrive in this environment?

      Remarkably, despite its location at the edge of the Sahara Desert, where sand meets the sea, Dakhla thrives in colder temperatures. Alongside the fishing industry, there is a crucial fish processing sector. The accompaying image illustrates the distribution of frozen fish processing plants in Morocco. This data is accessible through the Moroccan government's database called <a href="https://vest-sahara.s3.amazonaws.com/wsrw/feature-images/File/1389/645ce8da1ce79_Mer%2Ben%2BChiffres%2BDPM%2B2020%2BVF.pdf" style="text-decoration:none;color:blue"><em>La Mer en chiffres</em></a>.  
      
      Morocco is bordered by water on two sides, with the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Mediterranean Sea to the north. Despite the country's numerous port towns, Dakhla hosts over one-third of all frozen fish processing facilities of the entire country.</p>

      <p>While the sea undeniably serves as the lifeline and economic backbone of the region, our focus shifts to land when considering mobility. In this regard, Dakhla presents a fascinating paradox because, in today's market, one of the most coveted commodities is land; after all there's a mere 70 square kilometers of it available on this narrow peninsula. Leveraging Python, I developed a web scraper to meticulously gather comprehensive data on real estate listings in Dakhla. To my surprise, the dominant offering in the market is overwhelmingly land for sale.
      
      The following graph illustrates the distribution of real estate listings based on their respective types, shedding light on this intriguing trend.</p>

      <p>An unmistakable trend of development is gradually taking shape within the enchanting landscape of Dakhla. As we ponder the future of this region, several intriguing possibilities come to mind. Will Dakhla evolve into a haven for adventurous vacationers, drawn by the allure of the sea and the promise of immersive resort experiences? Or could it become a destination for displaced individuals seeking new opportunities and employment in this burgeoning hub? Perhaps, Dakhla is poised to offer a new wave of vacation properties, catering to the discerning tastes of the Moroccan middle class or elite in search of coastal retreats.</p>
      <br>
      <p>To gain deeper insights into these potential transformations, let's turn our attention to the following chart. It outlines the distribution of land across the Dakhla Peninsula, shedding light on the ongoing and anticipated developments that are set to shape the region's future.  50% of the land is undeveloped and 25% is already developed.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This pie chart may appear deceptively simple, but it actually involved a two-day process of gathering and analyzing data to create. First, a web scraper collected information about real estate for sale, and this data was pre-processed. Next, a shapefile of the Dakhla Peninsula was created using Google Earth Engine, enabling the measurement of its area. This polygon was then used to clip a GeoTiff file containing polygonss of all of the buildings from HumanData. The areas of all these building polygons were calculated and then combined to find the total are of the built environment. In summary, as of the time of writing, approximately one-fourth of all of the land on the peninsula is available for sale.</p>

      <p>When considering prospective land development, exotic vacation resorts might come to mind; however, the land acquisition trend around Dakhla is even more unusual. There is currently a $213 million investment project in agriculture around the city of Dakhla, both on the peninsula and on the mainland. The goal is to increase arable land on the seaward side of the Sahara by 52 square kilometers, which is indeed an amazing feat. How will crops thrive in this extreme environment?
        
      Unlike the regional capital of Laayoune to the north, Dakhla receives a fair amount of its water from aquifers. However, with increased agricultural activity, there is concern that the aquifers will be quickly depleted. Irrigation also relies on a wind-powered desalination plant. As part of the regional development plan, Dakhla will have a new port at a cost of $1 billion. Currently, just under 1000 hectares of land near the Dakhla peninsula are used by large-scale agro-industries, primarily owned by French agribusinesses or by 'Les Domaines Agricoles,' a Moroccan agricultural business owned by the royal family. Their annual revenue is estimated at $150 million, and nationwide, they own 12,000 hectares.</p>

      <p>You might be wondering what anyone could be growing down here. Drought-resistant crops like olives? Nuts? Argan trees, which have long been used to fight desertification? The answer is blueberries. Morocco is the leading exporter of blueberries to Middle Eastern countries and a significant exporter of blueberries to Europe. The growing season in Dakhla is six weeks longer than in Agadir, a few hundred kilometers to the north, and months longer than the growing season in Europe. Beyond blueberries, Dakhla is also home to cucumber, melon, and tomato farms. Morocco is now the world's third-largest exporter of tomatoes, with annual exports of more than 750,000 tons. Let's take a closer look. The following two graphs show the increase in blueberry and tomato exports from Morocco over a ten-year period.</p>
