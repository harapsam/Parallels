      <p>We've done it! We've finally arrived at our destination, 36 degrees north. Or perhaps, this isn't just the end; it's the opening scene of a thrilling tale. In truth, 36 degrees north doesn't land us in Morocco; it places us in the captivating strait that separates Spain and Morocco. But, for the sake of our narrative, we allowed a touch of creative latitude, and 36 degrees fits our story seamlessly.</p>
      <br>
      <p>So, picture this: we've arrived at a place where two worlds collide, where Europe and Africa brush shoulders across the shimmering waters of the strait. This isn't just a location; it's a metaphorical crossroads, a junction of possibilities. Our choice of 36 degrees north isn't just geographical; it's the start of an adventure where boundaries blur, and the ordinary transforms into the extraordinary.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We are concluding our narrative in Tangiers, which happens to be the northernmost major city in Morocco. This city holds a special place in history as a home away from home for the Beat Movement. In the past, Tangiers was often referred to as the "international zone," where almost anything was permissible and unconventional creativity thrived.</p>
      <br>
      <p>However, it's crucial to acknowledge that Tangiers, like any other place, has evolved significantly over the years. Given that the Beat Movement flourished there around 75 years ago, it's not surprising that the demographics, culture, and atmosphere of the city have undergone profound changes. The passage of time has brought about shifts in its population and character, reflecting the natural evolution of a dynamic and vibrant city.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>When we delve into the details of the population change and its implications for the city, it becomes all the more astonishing. A pie chart illustrates the percentage growth of the population over the years, and what it reveals is quite remarkable. Specifically, since the year 2000, the population of the city of Tangiers has experienced a significant surge.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In the bar chart presented below, it's evident that Tangiers is not an exception; it follows a similar trajectory as other major Moroccan cities like Casablanca and Rabat. Over the course of seven decades, from 1950 to the present, the population has witnessed an astounding six-fold increase. This surge in population signifies a profound transformation in the city, reflecting a dynamic shift in demographics and urbanization.  Maybe the economic possibilities are endless.</p>

      <p>It appears that we may have stumbled upon the answer to the question of where everyone has gone. There's a noticeable influx of people coming to this region, drawn from various parts of the country, particularly from the southern areas.  Coming from afar they continue long-standing traditions, like the way people source their food.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In cities like Casablanca, Rabat, and Tangiers, individuals who have migrated from the southern regions often establish small, independent, family-run stores within residential neighborhoods. These establishments, often referred to as 'dukan,' play a vital role in the community. Here, people can conveniently purchase not only food but also other essential items they need for their daily lives. These 'dukan' stores represent a Moroccan tradition that has stood the test of time and continues to thrive in the modern era. In essence, they are a contemporary manifestation of a way of life that has been part of Moroccan culture for centuries.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In addition to the small family-run stores, another integral aspect of Moroccan commerce is the presence of souqs. These souqs can take various forms, ranging from permanent or semi-permanent marketplaces to more makeshift setups, often consisting of a single individual selling vegetables from a cart. While these open-air marketplaces may seem more rudimentary compared to the established family-run stores, they are nonetheless an essential part of Moroccan tradition and commerce.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The souq culture reflects the vibrant and dynamic nature of Moroccan markets. In a permanent or semi-permanent souq, you can find a wide array of goods, from fresh produce and spices to clothing, handicrafts, and household items. These souqs often serve as bustling hubs of local activity and commerce, where people come to socialize, trade, and shop for their daily needs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>The level of prosperity for both sellers and buyers often manifests in the predominant type of stores found in a particular area. To gain insights into this dynamic, consider some intriguing data collected by grocery store chains. The following two graphs illustrate the ratio of markets to souqs, offering a glimpse into the prevalence of each type of establishment. This ratio informs us about the market-to-souq relationship in a given region.</p>
      <br>
      <p>To better understand the demographic and economic urban shift that occurs around the 33rd parallel, let's divide the data into two distinct charts. The first chart focuses on areas above the 33rd parallel, while the second chart concentrates on areas below it.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In the first chart, representing regions above the 33rd parallel, we observe a more typical distribution of the market-to-souq ratio. However, as we move to the second chart, which covers areas below the 33rd parallel, we notice a steeper curve. This steeper curve indicates less variability in the market-to-souq ratio. This observation likely stems from the fact that there are fewer markets and souqs in these southern regions overall. Nevertheless, when considering the average, the market-to-souq ratio tends to be higher below the 33rd parallel.</p>
      <br>
      <p>A lower ratio signifies that the population in these areas is more accustomed to modern transaction methods, as opposed to the traditional souq experience. It also implies a more stable and prosperous population, as these regions have adopted a greater number of market-style establishments compared to souqs. This data reflects not only economic disparities but also cultural and commercial preferences across different regions of the country.</p>

      <p>To delve deeper into this data, let's consider a chart that plots the market-to-souq ratio based on latitude. This chart provides us with valuable insights into how this ratio varies across different regions of Morocco.</p>
      <br>
      <p>When we examine this chart, we notice that Tangiers, situated in the north, shares the same market-to-souq ratio as Dakhla, which is located at the southernmost point of the country. However, it's essential to understand the nuances behind this similarity. In this chart, the darkness of each circle represents the total number of markets in the respective area.</p>
      <br>
      <p>For instance, Dakhla, although having the same ratio as cities in the north, possesses a relatively low ratio. This indicates that Dakhla likely has just one souq and one market, which results in the similarity in ratios. On the other hand, cities in the northern latitudes offer a more diverse array of markets to choose from, leading to a higher number of markets overall.</p>
      <br>
      <p>So, while the ratio may be the same, the underlying dynamics in these regions are quite different. The darker circles in the northern areas signify a more robust and varied marketplace, while the similarity in ratios between Dakhla and the northern cities reflects a difference in scale and the availability of shopping options in those regions.</p>

      <p>The phenomenon of small, family-owned stores that stay open late, typically until 10 or 11 pm, and offer a variety of food and goods is not unique to Morocco. These types of stores have also been a longstanding presence in Paris, primarily run by immigrants from North Africa. This trend dates back to the post-World War II era when France faced a labor shortage, and immigration played a pivotal role in its economic growth. These stores became an essential part of daily life in Paris, often colloquially referred to as <em>l’arabe du coin</em> (which roughly translates to 'the Arab on the corner'). Similar to Morocco, these shops provided a 'modern' shopping experience at a time when there were fewer chain grocery stores. They stayed open late, catering to people who needed to shop after work.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Immigrants from North Africa found these small stores to be a means to maintain a decent middle-class living while also being able to return to their home countries periodically. The operation of such stores proved lucrative, which is why, in the early 2000s, chain grocery stores began opening smaller, market-style outlets that stayed open late to meet the needs of evening shoppers. Their competitive strategy often involved offering lower prices, even selling at a loss, which encouraged consumers to shift away from <em>l’arabe du coin</em>.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In more recent time, advancements in technology, such as self-checkout options, has minimized the need for human interaction during shopping.  As a result, Arab immigrants who once owned these small stores transitioned to working as guards at chain-run stores, albeit without the same level of income they enjoyed as store owners. This shift has created a monotonous and often tedious job for them. It raises questions about why economic growth appears to come at the cost of destroying the livelihoods of working-class individuals.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Some interesting materials about the loss these traditional spaces for immigrant workers can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zplttxo4ZMs" style="text-decoration:none;">here</a> and <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/m-actu/article/2018/01/26/l-arabe-du-coin-une-epicierie-en-peril_5247679_4497186.html" style="text-decoration:none;">here</a>.</p>

        The first graph provided here, utilizing data obtained from Le Monde, illustrates the decline in the number of <em>arabe du coin</em> stores between 1960, which marked the peak of North African worker immigration, and 2018. The term <em>arabe du coin</em> refers to the small, family-owned stores typically run by North African immigrants in Paris.
        </p>
      <br>
      <p>The second graph showcases the current count of <em>épicerie</em>-style chain stores in Paris. These are larger retail chains that have opened space based on the traditional <em>arabe du coin</em> stores, often staying open late to cater to consumers.  There is no room for independent competition.</p>

      <p>Certainly, it's clear that the phenomenon we're discussing extends beyond Morocco and occupies a somewhat nebulous space. France has historically been a destination for hardworking Moroccans, many of whom aspired to become middle-class grocers. However, these aspirations have become increasingly unattainable in a world driven primarily by profit turnover. As a result, many Moroccans who leave their places of origin often migrate to urban centers within Morocco with hopes of starting a similar business—a business that was once an integral part of Parisian life.</p>
      <br>
      <p>What future lies in this pursuit? Our societal fixation on relentless economic growth and the redistribution of wealth that predominantly benefits the already wealthy is impacting Morocco as well. Large chain grocery stores have sprouted up across Morocco at an astonishing rate since the year 2000. To shed light on this expansion, the graph below illustrates the square meterage of chain grocery store space in the largest cities of Morocco.</p>

      <p>The following pie chart provides a breakdown of the distribution of retail space in various cities. Casablanca and Rabat, which happen to be the two fastest-growing cities in the country, are experiencing a significant shift in their consumption patterns. This shift is characterized by the gradual replacement of traditional retail models with industrial modernity.</p>
      <br>
      <p>We have already discussed the dispersion of the traditional souq, a bustling marketplace typically associated with a wide range of goods and vendors. In Casablanca and Rabat, this traditional souq is undergoing transformation as it gives way to smaller, but more 'modern' independent grocers. These independent grocers represent an intermediate stage between the traditional souq and the emergence of large chain-owned stores.</p>
      <br>
      <p>It is important to note that this transformation is ongoing. The pie chart underscores the fact that even these independent grocers are at risk of being eventually supplanted by chain-owned stores, a trend that has already taken hold in Casablanca. This transition reflects a broader shift towards modernization and standardized retail formats in urban areas, which can has profound cultural implications as traditional markets evolve in response to changing commercial practices.</p>

      <p>The largest chain retail grocery store in Morocco is Marjane. Unfortunately, Marjane's parent company has undergone several restructuring processes in recent years, which makes it impossible to obtain a clear and comprehensive view of their financial performance and their long-term market strategy for growth.</p>
      <br>
      <p>However, the next largest chain in the Moroccan grocery retail sector is Carrefour. Carrefour operates in Morocco as a subsidiary of LabelVie, which is the holding company for several significant big-box grocery store chains. To gain insight into their growth trajectory, we can refer to the following chart, which illustrates their expansion over the past decade as reported in their annual financial reports.</p>
      <br>
      <p>It's worth noting that as these large chain stores continue to expand, there may come a point where their growth potential becomes contingent on acquiring existing markets. This often translates into the acquisition or displacement of smaller, independent grocers that have traditionally been a part of the local retail landscape. This shift in the grocery retail landscape signifies a trend toward consolidation and market domination by larger chains, as happened in Paris, which can have far-reaching implications for the retail sector, consumer choices, and the livelihoods of small shop owners.</p>

      <p>Considering the current trends and dynamics discussed earlier, it's crucial to ponder the possible long-term outcomes of these developments. As we take a step back and contemplate the future of a country with a growing population that will be significantly impacted by climate change, dwindling renewable water resources, and desertification, it becomes clear that these factors will shape Morocco's trajectory in various ways.</p>
      <br>
      <p>To shed light on the human aspect of this complex landscape, let's examine once again data from the Missing Migrants Project. The two graphs provided reveal the substantial role that Morocco plays in the migration of populations. This isn't limited to Moroccans alone; it also encompasses migrants from sub-Saharan Africa who pass through Morocco on their journeys. According to the available data, it's important to note that there may be additional deaths that go unreported or remain unknown.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>In this context, Morocco accounts for a noteworthy 7% of migrant deaths in Africa and 4% of missing migrants globally. These statistics are indeed eye-opening and indicative of the challenges and risks faced by migrants who traverse the region. It underscores the gravity of the situation and the human toll that migration can exact, particularly in a region where environmental pressures and economic disparities often drive people to seek better opportunities elsewhere.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In summary, these statistics highlight the profound impact of migration on Morocco, both in terms of people emigrating, as well as migrants passing through the country and the challenges the country faces in managing this flow. They serve as a reminder of the need for comprehensive approaches to address the complex interplay between migration, climate change, and urban expansion.</p>

      <p>After our journey spanning approximately 16 degrees of latitude and covering a distance of about 2000 kilometers across Morocco, we find ourselves right back where we started, examining an image generated using QGIS. This image is based on data related to reported deaths of migrants. As a reminder, in this representation, the size of each circle corresponds to the number of migrants involved in each reported incident.</p>
      <br>
      <p>One notable observation from this visual representation is the presence of hotspots for migrant deaths in Tangiers and further north around the 36-degree latitude line. Additionally, another hotspot emerges to the east, around the area of Nador.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This pattern underscores the critical challenges and risks that migrants face when traveling through Morocco, particularly in these specific areas. Factors such as perilous sea crossings, harsh desert conditions, and attempts to access routes to Europe can lead to tragic outcomes for those seeking better opportunities or refuge.</p>

It also underscores the need for comprehensive policies and international cooperation to address the complex issues surrounding migration and border security.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In this climactic culmination of our journey, as we take a step back and soar high above the entire country, we are granted a vantage point that offers profound insights into the vast tapestry of migration confronting Morocco in the present day.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As the landscape unfolds below, it's impossible to ignore the profound impact of migration, not just as an abstract concept but as a tangible and deeply human experience. The nation's contours are etched with stories of resilience, hope, and the indomitable human spirit, as countless individuals seek new beginnings, opportunities, or sanctuary.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>This bird's-eye view transcends borders and boundaries, reminding us that the challenges and triumphs of migration are not confined to a single location or people. They are universal, transcending culture, language, and nationality. The journey is shared, the struggles are collective, and the dreams are held by all.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In this moment, let us reflect on the immense complexities and consequences of migration, recognizing that it's not merely a matter of statistics and data, but a profound human narrative. It beckons us to contemplate the responsibilities we share as global citizens, urging us to extend empathy, compassion, and solidarity to those who brave the unknown in search of a better life.</p>
      <br>
      <p>From this celestial vantage point, we are reminded that our world is interconnected, and the destinies of people are intertwined. The question we face is not just how we perceive migration from afar but how we choose to engage with it, for it is in our shared humanity and our collective actions that we shape the future of those who journey in search of hope, opportunity, and a brighter tomorrow.</p>
