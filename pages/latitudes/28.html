      <p>Let's shift our focus back to the realm of real estate. What opportunities lie in this domain throughout Morocco? What are the price tags attached? Let's embark on a journey to explore the available options.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Here, you'll find a graph that shows the inventory of properties on the market, neatly categorized across Morocco's administrative regions with the exception of Western Sahara which we covered in the first four latitudes. These regions unfold geographically, ordered from the southernmost tip to the northernmost expanse. The initial two entries are coastal regions where the cold waters of the Atlantic meet the hot sands of the Sahara.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The first entry in the list, Guelmim-Oued Noun, a region adorned with vast stretches of pristine beaches, seems to defy expectations with its scarce offering of properties for sale. The aura of the south, the very epitome of the global south, defines this area. The most economically challenged region in Morocco, it stands in solitude, its landscape mirroring its isolation. With a mere 26 millimeters of annual rainfall, it grapples with aridity. Outside the coastal areas life in this region is hard.  The aquifer underfoot yields a paltry flow of 0.1 liters of water per second, a testament to the challenge of sustaining life in this arid expanse.</p>

      <p>In the south, the Moroccan coastline is where the desert meets the sea. Stretching along the western edge of the African continent, it is the place of ancient maritime journeys, trade winds, and the echoes of civilizations now gone. The rugged Atlas Mountains almost reach the waves, creating a seamless fusion of mountain and ocean. Golden beaches unfold like desert sands, pushed up against the Atlantic. Ancient fortresses and medinas rise like sentinels against the backdrop of the waves, their timeless stone walls bearing witness to the passage of centuries. Bustling port cities hum with life, their markets fragrant with spices, textiles and incense. But it's not just a tale of history; it's a landscape that beckons to the present and future. The Moroccan coastline cradles a harmony of ecosystems, from the delicate interplay of coastal dunes to the fertile estuaries that teem with life. It's a sanctuary for seabirds and marine creatures, a canvas for artists and dreamers, a stage for surfers who ride the rhythm of the waves.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Guelmim-Oued Noun, located in southwestern Morocco, is characterized by its arid desert climate and diverse geological features. The region is situated within the larger context of the North African tectonic plate boundary, where the African Plate converges with the Eurasian Plate. This geological setting has contributed to the formation of various landscape features and mineral deposits. The region's arid climate is influenced by its proximity to the Sahara Desert, resulting in limited rainfall and high temperatures. This climate has shaped the landforms, including vast desert expanses, rocky plateaus, and oases sustained by underground water sources.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>Geologically, Guelmim-Oued Noun is rich in sedimentary formations, often composed of sandstone, limestone, and shale. These formations hold geological records of ancient environmental changes and offer insights into the region's past climates. Mineral resources also play a role in the area's economic livelihood. Additionally, Guelmim-Oued Noun's unique topography and geological formations contribute to its hydrogeological characteristics. The region's oases and underground water sources are vital for sustaining agriculture and human settlements, although they are among the most unproductive in all of Morocco, overused and risk eventual depletion.</p>

      <p>It's evident that there are a limited number of properties available for purchase in this area. Upon closer inspection of the region using Google Earth, we observe that the urban centers are compact and closely clustered. The diagram provided illustrates the various property types on the market, including apartments, villas, houses, and undeveloped land. Analyzing the ratio of each property type in relation to the overall properties for sale, we discover that vacant land constitutes a significant 46% of the real estate market in the region, but that land only accounts for 9% of the market. Land is still cheap here. All of the properties listed below are within six kilometers of the sea.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This agent-created land grab bears similarities to what has been observed in the cities of Dakhla and Laayoune. In those areas, there is a notable effort to sell substantial plots of land for various development purposes.  But what will be built here?  In the case of Dakhla, it has the potential to become a popular seaside resort destination, possibly due to its coastal location. In contrast, the situation in this area appears different, as there is a noticeable absence of a substantial influx of people. The population growth primarily stems from individuals moving from more rural parts of the region into its urban center.</p>

      <p>Infrastructure deficiencies are a pressing concern in the region of Guelmim, encompassing a range of critical issues such as inadequate water resources, underdeveloped sewage systems, and limited access to construction materials. These challenges collectively hamper the region's progress and development, making it an area of concern for both local residents and policymakers.</p>
      <br>
      <p>One significant piece of information shedding light on these infrastructure issues is the building shapefiles acquired from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX). These shapefiles, when configured in Geographic Information System (GIS) software like QGIS, provide valuable insights into the extent of the problem.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>For instance, one startling revelation from the analysis of these shapefiles is that despite Guelmim Oued Noun occupying approximately 10% of Morocco's total land area, the built environment in this region accounts for a mere 1% of the country's constructed spaces. This stark contrast highlights the severe underdevelopment of infrastructure and construction in the area.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Addressing these infrastructure deficiencies requires a concerted effort from both government agencies and non-governmental organizations. Potential solutions may include investment in infrastructure projects, improved access to resources, and the implementation of policies that promote sustainable development. Additionally, raising awareness about the challenges faced by Guelmim Oued Noun can lead to increased support and collaboration at the local, national, and international levels to alleviate these pressing issues and improve the quality of life for its residents.</p>

        <p>Certainly, the coastal region of southern Morocco is endowed with a unique and abundant resource: clouds. These ethereal formations have the potential to add character and dynamism to the skies, but they also present a challenge for those seeking pristine, uninterrupted views of the Earth's surface.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Efforts to capture cloud-free vistas are not limited to any single platform, as multiple strategies have been devised to tackle this obstacle. One approach involves the application of cloud detection algorithms combined with intricate image mosaicking techniques. These algorithms work diligently to identify and distinguish clouds within the vast repository of archived images gathered from various remote sensing platforms.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This clever amalgamation of technology enables the creation of composite images that effectively obscure cloud cover, granting users unimpeded access to clear, unobstructed views of our planet's surface. It represents a remarkable feat in the realm of Earth observation and satellite imagery, benefiting diverse fields such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster management.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column-overview">
        <p>However, even with these innovative methods at our disposal, the image below serves as a tangible testament to the enduring presence of cloud cover over the coastal region of southern Morocco.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The image displayed below provides compelling proof that, regardless of how frequently satellites orbit above, the coastal region of southern Morocco consistently eludes the prospect of a completely cloud-free sky.</p>

        <p>In this parallel region, one of the most precious and readily available resources is cloud cover. Nestled at Mount Boutmezguida, local residents have skillfully revived ancient indigenous wisdom to harness water from the clouds that grace their skies. Situated between the imposing Atlas and Anti-Atlas Mountains, approximately 30 kilometers inland from Sidi Ifni, which is the focal point of our real estate holdings in this area, this region faces the challenge of scanty rainfall.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Innovatively adapting to this climatic reality, the inhabitants have taken to erecting extensive wire mesh fences, strategically positioned to capture water from the ascending sea air. This unique approach to water harvesting has proven to be remarkably effective, with each square meter of wire mesh fencing capable of collecting around 20 liters of water. This method results in an astounding daily water collection of 37,400 liters, akin to a form of cloud fishing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column-overview">
        <p>In conclusion, the ingenuity displayed in capturing water from clouds in this unique region highlights the incredible potential for human adaptation and resourcefulness. It underscores the importance of preserving and sharing such valuable indigenous knowledge while offering a sustainable solution to address water scarcity challenges in regions with similar climatic constraints.</p>
