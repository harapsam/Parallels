      <p>As we continue our journey northward, just before reaching our next intended destination, let's embark on a brief detour and pause at a latitude that seems to be causing a touch of confusion - is it 32°24'58", or perhaps 32°29'21"? Regardless of the exact coordinates, one thing remains indisputable: these points of interest are situated on opposite sides of the imposing Al Massira Dam.</p>
      <br>
      <p>During the reign of Hassan II, the government initiated a bold plan, often colloquially referred to as 'a dam a year.' This ambitious endeavor had a straightforward yet crucial objective - to construct a new dam each year. The primary aim behind this endeavor was to establish a stable and dependable water supply system to cater to the needs of Morocco's burgeoning population.</p>
      <br>
      <p>One of the noteworthy outcomes of this initiative was the creation of the Eddahbi Mansour Dam in the picturesque Draa Valley that we have already visited, a testament to the nation's commitment to its water management goals. This dam, along with others, was instrumental in achieving the vision of a 'dam a year.'</p>
      <br>
      <p>The banner displayed at the top of this page provides a visual representation of the declining water resources held by the Al Massira Dam, positioned at latitude 32°28'38". This visual representation serves as a stark reminder of the dam's crucial role in securing water resources for the region, and it underscores the importance of sustainable water management practices in the face of increasing public water needs.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The provided visual representation illustrates the largest dams in Morocco, showcasing not only their respective dates of construction but also their heights. The color gradient employed in the graph effectively conveys the varying degrees of water retention capacity associated with these dams, with darker shades denoting greater capacity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>A discernible trend emerges as we analyze the data: throughout the 20th century, there is a notable progression towards larger and more ambitious dam construction projects in Morocco. This evolution underscores the nation's growing commitment to harnessing its water resources for a variety of purposes, such as irrigation, hydroelectric power generation, and water supply.</p>

      <p>On the southern bank of the retention lake, you'll find the quaint town of Ouled Aissa, situated precisely at latitude 32°29'21”. Meanwhile, on the northern shoreline, lies the town of Ouled Essi Masoud, positioned at a latitude of 32°24'58". These two towns, although geographically distinct, face an intriguing administrative conundrum. Despite their relatively close proximity, distinguishing them from one another on paper can be surprisingly challenging.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The curious aspect of this situation arises from the fact that the most direct route between these two towns entails a circumnavigation around the Al Massira Dam, which spans a distance of approximately 12 miles. This circumferential path is necessitated by the physical barrier posed by the lake, making it the only practical route for travel between Ouled Aissa and Ouled Essi Masoud. It's worth noting that this dam, while serving as a vital resource for water retention, also introduces a significant detour for those wishing to travel between the two towns.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>Intriguingly, when measured in a straight line, or what is referred to as the Euclidean distance, the gap between Ouled Aissa and Ouled Essi Masoud is only about 6 miles. This seemingly shorter distance highlights the unique topographical challenge presented by the Al Massira Dam, which, in essence, doubles the actual distance one must travel to get from one town to the other. This situation underscores how geographical features can play a pivotal role in shaping the administrative and logistical aspects of a region, often resulting in peculiar quirks like this one, where proximity on the map does not necessarily translate to ease of movement in reality.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The policy of constructing a new dam each year in Morocco is not only continuing but also gaining momentum. Morocco has set its sights on an ambitious goal of erecting 50 additional dams by the year 2050.  You can read about the project<a href="https://www.afrik21.africa/en/morocco-government-aims-to-build-50-dams-by-2050/" style="text-decoration:none; color:#A6F6FF"> here</a>.</p>

      <p>To assess the effectiveness of this program, we must consider the backdrop of this tranquil region, which has enjoyed a sense of ease and relative isolation from the tumultuous changes that have swept across other parts of the world. This tranquility persisted until the onset of a significant environmental challenge – a prolonged disruption in weather patterns and the emergence of long-term climate trends that have profoundly impacted the region.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This once-peaceful haven, seemingly untouched by the relentless march of time and the accompanying stress of change, found itself grappling with a new reality – a persistent absence of rainfall. Even within the corridors of government administration, the situation has induced a degree of perplexity. The confusion is exemplified by the two neighboring towns, Ouled Essi Masoud and Ouled Aissa, whose names bear a striking resemblance and have occasionally fallen victim to bureaucratic oversight, amalgamating into the whimsical and nonexistent entity of "Oued Aissa Masoud".</p>
      <br>
      <p>However, despite these administrative mix-ups, both towns share a common plight: the gradual and disheartening retreat of the waterline of Almassira Lake; there hasn't been substantial rainfall here in five years.  This common challenge underscores the gravity of the situation and serves as a stark reminder of the urgent need for effective intervention to mitigate the impacts of changing weather patterns and long-term climate shifts on this tranquil and historically undisturbed region. The success of the program in addressing these challenges is pivotal not only for the well-being of the local communities but also for preserving the unique character of this peaceful oasis in the face of an increasingly unpredictable environment.</p>

      <p>The image presented here is a composite representation comprised of two distinct segments, each derived from raster images obtained through remote sensing technology, specifically focusing on the monitoring of surface water. This collection of images, cataloged under the label “JRC/GSW1_4/GlobalSurfaceWater”, is categorized into two distinct epochs: the first epoch spanning from 1984 to the year 2000, and the second epoch continuing from 2000 up to the present day.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The first composite image offers a visual depiction of the baseline state of surface water as it appeared during the initial phase of remote sensing, which serves as a reference point for analysis. In contrast, the second segment of the composite image presents a more intricate and revealing picture. It showcases the average changes in surface water observed between the first epoch and the second epoch.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This visual representation carries profound implications. The red contours indeed look frightening and represent surface water that has been completely lost. As we move up the spectrum towards blue, the colors represent a higher frequency of surface water. However, the amount of water that is present all year long has drastically diminished.  By comparing these two epochs, we gain insights into the evolving dynamics of surface water over time. The contrasting colors and patterns in the second image vividly illustrate shifts and alterations in surface water bodies, highlighting areas of increase, decrease, or stability. The Almassira Lake is half the size it was 40 years ago.</p>

      <p>The dwindling size of this reservoir carries significant and far-reaching implications for the future, particularly as it serves as the primary source of renewable water resources for the bustling metropolis of Casablanca. It's crucial to recognize that the ramifications of this shrinking reservoir extend beyond its immediate vicinity, affecting the livelihoods and sustenance of a large urban population.  In light of this predicament, a viable strategy to counteract the loss of water resources has emerged—the desalination of seawater to meet the public's water demands.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Now, shifting our focus eastward, we arrive at the smaller city of Beni Mellal. Here, we've delved into the real estate landscape of Beni Mellal, revealing some intriguing insights. While the price per square meter in this city is relatively low, it's not the lowest among the regions studied. However, what makes Beni Mellal particularly noteworthy is the overlay of weather data, depicting changes in average rainfall between Epoch 1 and Epoch 2.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In the following graph, real estate data per region is plotted according to price per square meter.  Colors take center stage, with blue symbolizing regions where rainfall has remained stable and red representing areas where rainfall has decreased. Of particular concern is the fact that Beni Mellal emerges as the darkest red region, signifying the most substantial decline in rainfall since the year 2000, according to data sourced from weather station 601910.  The change in average annual rainfall has decreased by 50 millimeters.</p>

      <p style="margin-top:20%;">Allow us to examine the data more closely. Within the forthcoming graph, we discern a noteworthy trend in precipitation measurements evolving over time—an unmistakable and consistent decrease. This trend reveals valuable insights into how rainfall patterns have evolved and may have significant implications for various sectors reliant on these data points, such as agriculture, water resource management, and climate science.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>In the subsequent two graphs, we present a comprehensive picture of the evolving climate conditions. The first graph illustrates the alteration in average temperatures over an extended period, while the second one tracks the variation in high temperatures during the same timeframe. These graphical representations unequivocally depict a compelling trend: a gradual and sustained increase in temperature, coupled with a concurrent reduction in precipitation levels.</p>

      <p style="margin-top:25%;">The Beni Mellal region boasts a significant abundance of real estate listings, both within the city, its outskirts and in regional towns. What's particularly intriguing is the substantial presence of properties in the pre-construction phase among these listings. This phenomenon stands in stark contrast to the prevalent trend of readily available apartments in the area. It's worth noting that this differs markedly from the real estate dynamics in Western Sahara, where much of the land was for sale.  There is no land for sale here, even though arable land is not nearly as scarce as in the more southern regions, although it will be if stops raining.</p>

      <p style="margin-top:20%">In light of the bustling construction activity in the area, one might wonder about the nature of these ongoing developments. A glimpse into the historical data regarding completed construction projects in the region provides valuable insights.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Predominantly, the major construction endeavors have been focused on low-income housing, although there has been a noticeable decline in this category. On the other hand, luxury apartment construction is showing an upward trend, but it still constitutes a relatively small fraction of the total construction projects. Surprisingly, villas are a rarity in Beni Mellal, and there are years when none are built at all.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This data underscores an important aspect of the local demographics and economy. It suggests that the population of Beni Mellal is, on average, less affluent than their counterparts in other parts of the country. The emphasis on low-income housing and the scarcity of luxury villas indicate a distinct economic profile, providing valuable context for understanding the region's real estate market and socioeconomic dynamics.</p>

      <p>The evidence supporting this notion becomes more compelling when we delve into real estate prices per square meter. In Beni Mellal, housing is notably budget-friendly. The kernel density estimation chart below vividly illustrates this affordability, revealing that the average living space encompasses just under 100 square meters and comes at a rate of approximately $500 per square meter. It's safe to say that this represents a remarkable value proposition for potential buyers, if they can afford it.</p>

      <p style="margin-top:20%;">Our real estate data begins to sculpt a narrative that unfolds the intriguing story of Morocco. Beni Mellal, in particular, emerges as just one of the characters in this tale. The real estate landscape here is marked by an undeniable trait: affordability. A surplus of available properties further underscores this point.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This phenomenon speaks volumes about the region's demographic dynamics, hinting at a population that is in flux, on the move. The questions that arise are profound. Could the specter of climate change be exerting its pressure on the inhabitants of this area? Are they, in response, embarking on quests for new horizons, driven by a pursuit of enhanced opportunities elsewhere?</p>
      <br>
      <p>If such migrations are indeed transpiring, the nature of these opportunities becomes a captivating enigma. What beckons these individuals to explore new pastures? Is it the promise of economic prosperity, improved living conditions, or a sanctuary from the encroaching impacts of a changing climate? These questions form the crux of our exploration into the intricate relationship between demographics, climate, and aspirations in this dynamic corner of Morocco.</p>
