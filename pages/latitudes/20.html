      <p>In the midst of our daily routines — from connecting with friends and family to commuting to work, or embarking on journeys like visiting relatives or exciting adventures like a trip to Morocco for example — we often give little consideration to our exact place on the global map.  While we readily know our nationality and what country we're in, what I'm referring to is our relative ignorance of our precise geographical coordinates - our longitude and latitude. When we glance at these two numerical values that pinpoint our exact position on the Earth's surface, it's not uncommon for them to become muddled in our minds, for us to even confuse the two.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>Even someone with just a basic grasp of coordinate reference systems might find it astonishing that our tale commences at the 20th parallel north. “Morocco is not located all the way down here!”, one might exclaim.   "Where are the souks of Marrakech?  The cannabis smokers of Chefchaouen?  The hustle and bustle of Casablanca?"  That Morocco is far from the 20th parallel. Down here, one encounters the eerie winds that carry dry sands, showering them like salt upon the azure canvas of the sea. The days can stretch interminably, and time seems to halt as the clock's ticking surrenders to the sun's zenith. People emerge onto the planet's surface frailly, leaving only faint traces, flattened by the scorching sun and sweltering heat. It is here that we truly fathom the gravity of existence on a rocky sphere whirling through a solar system filled with other rocky orbs, all enveloped in the incomprehensible vastness of gases and solid matter.</p>

      <p>Here is where Morocco begins – on a slender, rocky peninsula that stretches from north to south along the western coast of Africa. This piece of land starts to diverge from the African continent at the 21st parallel north, and at its widest point, it measures a mere thirteen kilometers across. Despite its perilous narrowness, the peninsula is bisected lengthwise by three uncrossable borders, each dissecting into even narrower slivers an already confined slice of land. Seventy miles to the south, as the peninsula tapers, on the western side facing the sea but positioned just far enough to be sheltered from its influence, you'll find the town of La Gouira. Here, there is an eerie absence of noise, a profound stillness that envelops what has become a desolate extension of Moroccan authority in the region. There are no families or children, no cats or dogs to be found in this solitude, even plants are rare.</p>

      <p>Located on the western edge of the Ras Nouadhibou Peninsula, the Spanish once asserted their territorial rights in this region. The need arose to establish a clear demarcation between Mauritania, which exercised control over the eastern part of the peninsula, and the western side, which was claimed by the French. In response to this complex situation, Francisco Bens took the initiative to found a settlement on behalf of the Spanish government in 1920.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>This action was not merely a matter of marking a geographical boundary; it represented a pivotal moment in the historical and geopolitical context of the time. The colonial powers of Europe were actively engaged in asserting their influence and control over various parts of Africa, and this region was no exception, despite the fact the only resource in the area is fish.  Even drinkable water is scarce. By establishing a town in the name of the Spanish government, Francisco Bens played a role in solidifying Spanish presence and authority in this strategically significant location.</p>

  <div class="row-overview">
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>The choice of location and the founding of the town were significant actions that reflected the intricate interplay of colonial interests, territorial disputes, and political maneuvering that characterized this era. It underscores how geographical boundaries were often drawn and redrawn creating territories of linear regularity that fit together like interlocking Lego bricks to serve the interests of colonial powers, with lasting implications for the regions and people involved.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>Let’s backtrack just for a moment.  In truth, our narrative commences six kilometers to the south, at Cape Blanc. While the colonizers have departed, their legacies endure; in this corner of the globe, the influence of the French colonial era is never far from mind and always on the tip of our tongues. In the nineteenth century, the Spanish staked their claim on the western African coastline, stretching from Cape Bojador to Cape Blanc, and eventually merged these territories to create the colony referred to for fifty years as Spanish Sahara. Under the pressure of international demands and United Nations resolutions promoting decolonization, Spain withdrew from the region in 1976, leading to its current designation as Western Sahara.</p>

      <p>The Spanish officially left La Gouira in 1976, and is now looked over by Mauritanian troops despite the fact is not in their control.  Images captured on Google Earth show that even the stranded desert on this narrow strip of land enfroces its hegemony over people, slowly invading streets and buildings.</p>

      <p>But where is the data? Where can we find information that can tell us something about this region? Down here, it's a latitude without people. The two images below are extracted from Google Earth Engine global surface water raster files and tell us a lot about the precarious nature of life. Global surface water remote sensing images are captured every 16 days and are then categorized into two groups: epoch one from 1984 to the year 2000, and epoch two extending from 2000 until today. The image on the left shows the difference in average surface water calculated between epochs one and two. The dark green patches at the top of the peninsula show a reduction in surface water. The second image shows the overall reduction of global surface water from the year 2000 until today. It clearly shows that since 2000, almost all of the surface water has completely disappeared, as shown in red.</p>

      <p>Things don't seem to change much down here, especially in the absence of human presence. More recent events have been quite chaotic. In 2015, the Polisario Front, acting on behalf of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, set up an outpost in La Gouira. In response, the Moroccan government, operating from a town at the top of the peninsula, Guerguerat, attempted to build a road extending into Mauritania, crossing the Berm and Polisario-controlled territory. What was the purpose of this road? The following image is an aerial shot of the town of Guerguerat, with a population of 28. The road is that solitary road crossing the desert.  What are the consequences of these events that seem to occur almost in isolation?</p>

      <p>The following images depict graphs derived from data collected by the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) illustrating the number of individuals seeking asylum. These visual representations have been generated using Seaborn, a data visualization library. While the figures may appear relatively modest, typically numbering in the hundreds, their significance becomes apparent when considered within the context of the sparsely populated region under study.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Notably, we can observe a striking surge in asylum applications during the year 2016. It's important to recognize that bureaucratic processes inherently involve time delays. Initially, a larger portion of applicants face rejection compared to those granted refugee status. However, over a span of two to three years, we witness a notable increase in the number of individuals successfully recognized as legal refugees.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This trend aligns with the broader backdrop of a conflict between nations that has gone relatively unnoticed on the global stage, leading to an escalating displacement crisis. The data thus paints a vivid picture of the evolving humanitarian situation in the region.  It tells the story of a parallel with few people, of people on the move.</p>
