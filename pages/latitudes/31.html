      <p>To commence our Marrakech journey, let's delve into the real estate landscape. What options await us? The presence of international buyers has left a mark on this city. There are no limitations on foreign property ownership, facilitating the mobility of overseas investors seeking second homes or retirement residences. Unfortunately, this accessibility has made it increasingly challenging for locals to purchase property in Marrakech. Despite its historical significance, a large portion of Marrakech's economy caters to the needs of foreign visitors. In fact, an online investment source I came across suggests that investing in the area is a wise choice due to its status as the "most established and beloved tourist destination in the region."</p>
      <br>
      <p>When we scrutinize the diverse range of properties on the market in all of Morocco, one location emerges prominently: Marrakech. What's the story behind the profusion of properties available here? Marrakech has a rich history, serving as the central urban hub for caravans venturing across the Sahara from Timbuktu. Over countless centuries, it has remained a vibrant center of culture and commerce. In its evolution, Marrakech became a captivating haven for the French at one juncture, followed by a retreat for the Beat Movement. Positioned conveniently along the 31st parallel, it beckons as our next destination along the latitudes.  When we look at the properties for sale in Morocco, an overwhelming majority of real estate for sale is in Marrakech.</p>

        <p>Souss Massa, Casablanca Settat, Rabat Sale Kenitra, Tangier, Tetouan, and Al Hoceima constitute coastal regions with a noticeable abundance of available properties. In contrast, Marrakech's significance, despite its lack of a coastal position, was not rooted in opulence or trade, but rather in its access to water. As depicted in the image below, the azure hue along this latitude is alluring. However, this perception is deceptive, for the color isn't truly blue; it's, in fact, a vibrant green. The amalgamated image displayed here, compiled from a collection of Landsat 8 raster images accessible through Google Earth Engine, showcases a false-color NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) designed to capture visible and near-infrared light reflections from vegetation. Hence, the supposed blue indicates not water, but rather the presence of vegetation. It's distinctly evident that the stretch between Marrakech and Timbuktu features sparse vegetation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Marrakech's surprising greenery, despite its location on the windward side of the Atlas mountain range, can be attributed to a combination of factors, one of which is its unique access to water resources. While it does receive some humid air from the sea, a significant portion of that humidity is lost before it reaches Marrakech due to the mountainous terrain. So, how does Marrakech maintain its green appearance?</p>

          <p>To answer this question, we can turn to the following graph, which illustrates the average flow rate of aquifer boreholes in various regions, using data provided by the British Geological Survey. Notably, the region around Beni Mellal exhibits a range of flow rates, with some areas having a high flow rate while others only have a trickle of water, as indicated by the large standard deviation.</p>
          <br>
          <p>However, what makes Marrakech stand out is its reliance on an aquifer with one of the highest borehole flow rates in all of Morocco, occasionally reaching an impressive 30 liters per second. This is a remarkably high flow rate, considering that the average flow rate for the entire country of Morocco hovers around a mere 4 liters per second. This essentially means that Marrakech is exceptionally water-rich compared to other regions in Morocco, including the densely populated northern areas of the country.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The availability of this substantial underground water source has historically played a pivotal role in Marrakech's ability to sustain lush green landscapes, nourish agriculture, and support its population. It has allowed the city to thrive in an otherwise arid region, making it a vital oasis and a center of culture and trade for centuries.</p>

        <p>The diagram below presents the average property price per square meter, highlighting a distinct difference between coastal and inland areas, with the exception of Marrakech. The regions are arranged in a south-to-north sequence, and as we move north, the property cost per square meter gradually increases, reaching its peak in the northernmost city, Tangiers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In contrast, Marrakech stands out as a strong player in the real estate sector, even though it doesn't have a coastal location. Many French investors choose to buy property there, either for vacation homes or as a retirement destination, with a particular emphasis on high-end properties. Despite the abundant supply of properties available in Marrakech, prices in the area have remained relatively high.</p>

      <p>The map displayed here, sourced from Google Maps, provides a comprehensive view of the city of Marrakech and its diverse neighborhoods. In the upper right corner, you'll notice the historic heart of the city, the Medina, characterized by its labyrinthine narrow streets and traditional mud brick buildings that encapsulate centuries of Moroccan culture and history.</p>
      <br>
      <p>As you shift your gaze to the left on the map, you'll encounter the district of Gueliz, a sort of ville nouvelle, testament to Marrakech's colonial history under French control. Gueliz exhibits a different architectural style and urban planning compared to the Medina, showcasing the European influence from that era.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Continuing to the left on the map, you'll arrive at the upscale neighborhood known as Hivernage. This area is renowned for its modern amenities, luxury hotels, and vibrant nightlife. It stands as a stark contrast to the more traditional settings of the Medina and Gueliz.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Lastly, as you venture further to the left on the map, you'll discover the most exclusive part of Marrakech, the Palmeraie. Here, you'll find opulent resorts, expansive gardens, and prestigious residences set against the backdrop of lush palm groves. The Palmeraie epitomizes luxury and tranquility, making it a favored destination for discerning travelers and residents alike.</p>

      <p>The map provided employs population density data to visually represent the distribution of inhabitants per square kilometer across the city. The findings are quite evident: the medieval core of the city exhibits the highest population density, with people living in close proximity to one another.  As one ventures outward from the historic center of the city, the availability of space becomes more apparent. Moving towards the west, we encounter Gueliz, which boasts a lower population density in comparison to the medieval quarters. This area's design, influenced by the French colonial era, allows for more spacious living arrangements.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Continuing further to the west on the map, we come upon the district of Hivernage. Here, the population density is even more dispersed, reflecting a modern and cosmopolitan setting. Hivernage's landscape offers greater room for urban development and leisure amenities.  Lastly, if we shift our attention to the far west, we find the Palmeraie, an expanse of land characterized by luxury villas and substantial estates. This area, with its large plots and greenery, epitomizes opulence and tranquility. The sparse population density in the Palmeraie underscores the exclusivity and spaciousness afforded to its residents.</p>

      <p>Typically, in real estate, there's a common trend where smaller properties tend to command a higher price per square meter, as was previously demonstrated in the real estate study conducted in Paris. However, Marrakech presents a unique scenario. The graph below offers a detailed breakdown of real estate prices across different areas of Marrakech, expressed in US dollars. In this Moroccan city, the traditional rules don't quite apply.  For instance, when we look at the Medina, we see that despite the smaller and more cramped living spaces, the property values are remarkably high. This might seem counterintuitive, but it reflects the historical significance and cultural allure of this ancient district.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In stark contrast, Hivernage emerges as the most expensive area in terms of real estate prices per square meter. This district is characterized by luxurious villas and expansive gardens, attracting affluent individuals from Gulf countries and Europe. These high-net-worth buyers are willing to pay a premium for the exclusivity, modern amenities, and spacious living arrangements that Hivernage offers.  This intriguing divergence from the conventional real estate pricing model underscores the unique dynamics of Marrakech's property market. Here, the combination of cultural heritage, modern luxury, and international demand results in property valuations that may defy the usual expectations, making it a particularly fascinating market for real estate investors and enthusiasts alike.  The colors on the graph correspond to the colors on the population density map above.</p>

      <p>What can we expect the weather to be like in 2050? To answer this question, let's examine the two graphs below, which utilize historical weather data from weather station 602300 (GMMX) located at latitude 31.6. These graphs provide valuable insights into the evolving climate trends in this region over the years.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Since 1975, a clear pattern has emerged from the data. First, there has been a noticeable decline in rainfall levels, indicating a trend towards drier conditions. Simultaneously, the data reveals a consistent rise in average temperatures. The regression line for average temperature appears to follow a steep upward trajectory, suggesting a significant warming trend in the area.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The question arises: Can we use data analysis tools to create a predictive model for weather conditions in 2050, assuming all other external variables remain constant? Using a basic linear regression model, we can make some projections.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>According to this model, in 2050, we can anticipate an average temperature of approximately 22.2 degrees Celsius. This represents only a marginal increase of one degree from the current conditions in 2023. Furthermore, the model suggests a substantial decrease in rainfall, with an estimated 110 millimeters of precipitation in 2050. This signifies an 80 millimeter reduction compared to the current levels.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If this projected temperature increase appears uncomfortably warm, it prompts us to consider alternative strategies. To address potentially rising temperatures, individuals and communities may need to explore adaptive measures such as improved cooling systems, urban planning, and sustainable landscaping to mitigate the effects of climate change. Additionally, efforts to conserve and manage water resources will be crucial in light of decreasing rainfall.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In summary, while the predictive model indicates a modest increase in temperature and a decrease in rainfall by 2050, it underscores the importance of proactive climate adaptation measures to ensure the well-being and sustainability of the region in the face of changing weather patterns.  For the moment people are moving to Marrakech.  How long will it be before people start leaving the city because of an unliveable climate?</p>
