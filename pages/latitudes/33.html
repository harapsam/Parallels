      <p>As we venture further north in Morocco, we encounter regions that exhibit increasingly dense human habitation. Morocco's eastern expansion is curtailed by the vast expanse of the sea, and as a result, a significant majority of the population gravitates toward the western regions, mirroring the natural contours of the coastline. When we continue our northern journey, hugging the western edge as closely as possible, one prominent destination comes into focus: Casablanca.</p>
      <br>
      <p>A visual representation of Moroccan cities with populations exceeding 1,000 is presented in the graph below, but it proves challenging to discern meaningful patterns. The graph employs the x-axis to measure population in millions, yet it remains somewhat incomprehensible due to a striking outlier: Casablanca. It's the orange dot all the way on the right of the graph.  This dynamic city significantly deviates from the norm, pushing all other towns and municipalities into a tight cluster along the y-axis, with populations ranging from 0 to 1,000,000 inhabitants.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In stark contrast, Casablanca extends its boundaries far beyond this constrained range, boasting a population that surpasses the 4,000,000 mark. This extraordinary demographic divergence positions Casablanca as a significant outlier within Morocco's urban landscape, challenging conventional expectations and illustrating the unique character of this coastal metropolis.</p>

      <p>The significance of Casablanca in the context of demographic analysis within Morocco is a well-established and enduring phenomenon. Casablanca has played a pivotal role in the country's demographic landscape, a role that dates back to colonial times when the visionary French urbanist Henri Prost envisioned it as the "New York of North Africa." This foresight has had a lasting impact on the city's development and demographic trends.</p>
      <br>
      <p>A compelling insight arises when we delve into population data spanning from 1950 to the present day: the city's population growth exhibits a strikingly consistent pattern, resembling a linear trajectory at a 45-degree angle on a graph. In this context, a slope of one signifies a consistent population increase of 500,000 residents approximately every ten years. This remarkable continuity underscores the stability and reliability of Casablanca's population growth, making it a standout case in demographic analyses not only in Morocco but also on a global scale.</p>
      <br>
      <br>

    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>This robust trend appears to be deeply rooted in the city's socio-economic dynamics, historical significance, and strategic geographic location. Casablanca's allure as a center for commerce, industry, and opportunity has drawn people from various parts of Morocco and beyond. Moreover, the city's climatic conditions and available economic opportunities continue to attract individuals and families, contributing to its ongoing population expansion.</p>
      <br>
      <p>When we consider the available data on population density and climatic factors, there are no immediate indications or projections suggesting a deviation from this established growth trajectory in the foreseeable future. Casablanca's unique status as a demographic outlier within Morocco exemplifies the enduring allure of this dynamic city and the consistent opportunities it offers to those who call it home.</p>
      <br>
      <p>When we examine the percentage of the Casablanca population divided by ethnic groups, it becomes clear how, despite massive internal migration of Moroccans displaced from rural areas after losing their land and in search of work, foreigners made up a significant portion of the city's population during the first part of the 20th century. After gaining independence, the number of foreigners decreased. As of 2023, the number of immigrant residents in Casablanca is minimal, as is the Jewish population, which largely emigrated to Israel after the country's creation in 1948.</p>

      <p>The image you see below, created using QGIS software, provides a compelling visual representation of Morocco's urban landscape. It illustrates that Morocco is home to only a select few cities whose populations exceed the significant milestone of one million inhabitants. Among these urban centers, Casablanca emerges as the undeniable standout, being the sole city that boasts a population exceeding the threshold of two million people.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Within this visual depiction, Casablanca is unmistakably identifiable as the dominant presence on the map. It is represented by a prominent, radiant yellow dot positioned conspicuously on the left-hand side, roughly halfway between the top and bottom edges of the image. This glowing yellow dot serves as a compelling focal point, drawing immediate attention to the magnitude of Casablanca's population compared to other cities in Morocco.</p>

      <p>Upon analyzing Morocco's entire population, which includes calculating the Euclidean distance to the nearest coastline, a fascinating and striking narrative begins to take shape. This demographic study paints a vivid picture of a populace that predominantly congregates along the rugged coastlines, leaving the country's interior relatively sparsely inhabited by comparison.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Intriguingly, the data reveals that a substantial 69% of Morocco's population chooses to reside within a close proximity of just 100 kilometers from the sea, which is approximately equivalent to 62 miles. This concentration of people near the coastline not only showcases the nation's strong connection to its maritime heritage but also highlights the pivotal role that coastal areas play in terms of commerce, culture, and infrastructure development. This demographic pattern may hold valuable insights for urban planning, resource allocation, and environmental considerations within Morocco.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The distribution of the poplution relative to the distance to the coast is shown on the following pie chart.</p>

      <p>Analyzing the population density files for a twenty-year period (2000-2020) accessible on WorldPop, we have the capability to visualize them using QGIS and create a GIF by amalgamating all the images. Uninhabited regions are depicted in a deep blue hue, while the color lightens in proportion to the population density per square kilometer. Highly populated urban zones are represented in red. The image presented below narrates more than just the growth of urban and suburban territories (the vibrant green regions the have a stronger glow over a twenty year period); it also illustrates a migration away from distant rural areas. This is visible in the lavender areas the slowly disappear over time in the south and the south eastern border of the country. This is significant because during the same twenty-year period, the overall population of the country increased by 22%.</p>

      <p>The following chart provides a breakdown of the national population distribution across various regions. Notably, Casablanca emerges as the most populous region, accommodating approximately 31% of the entire country's population. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the population, totaling 68%, is concentrated within five prominent urban centers: Casablanca, Rabat, Fez, Marrakech and Tangiers.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This concentration highlights the significance of these strategic metropolitan areas in terms of population density and urbanization within the country. A key question is where do incoming rural workers reside? What kinds of lives do they have and what do Morocco's cities do to accomodate a migrating population? We won't find the answer anaylyzing weather or aquifer conditions, but construction data.</p>

      <p>The following graph illustrates the cumulative concrete consumption for each region during the period spanning from 2015 to 2020. Unsurprisingly, Casablanca prominently emerges as the leading consumer of concrete among all the regions. Following closely behind are the coastal urban hubs of Rabat and Tangiers. It's worth noting that the data from the Moroccan government combines Fez and Oriental into a single region impossible for us to separate, and similarly, the entire southern part of the country, comprising four distinct administrative regions, is grouped together. Nevertheless, even when combined, these southern regions do not surpass the concrete consumption of other areas in construction activities. At a glance, this correlates well with the patterns of internal migration and analysis of population density over time has provided us.</p>

      <p>Our data analysis harmonizes seamlessly with the open data shared by the Moroccan government regarding the status of completed construction sites. The graph presented below offers a comprehensive overview of the statistics pertaining to the number of construction projects completed in the year 2020, all of which were dutifully registered with the government as is required by law</p>
      <br>
      <p>Once more, the data unequivocally underscores Casablanca's exceptional position in this context. It emerges as the indisputable leader, exhibiting a substantial lead over other regions in terms of completed construction sites. The prominence of Casablanca in the graph is striking, signifying its pivotal role in the construction sector within Morocco for the specified year.</p>

      <p>Indeed, the city of Casablanca is experiencing a surge in construction activity. However, it's crucial to delve deeper into the nature of these ongoing developments. With the assistance of data provided by the Moroccan government, we can gain a more nuanced understanding. The accompanying pie chart sheds light on the specific types of construction projects taking place in Casablanca.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Notably, the preponderance of construction efforts in Casablanca is directed towards the creation of affordable, low-income housing. This observation carries significant implications, pointing towards the city's continuous response to the pressing issue of accommodating underprivileged and displaced individuals. Analyzing this data in conjunction with the previously examined pie chart detailing the ethnic composition of the population, it becomes evident that the influx of foreign migrants from other African or Middle Eastern countries does not constitute a substantial proportion of Casablanca's residents.  Instead, the majority of these construction projects are likely aimed at addressing the needs of displaced people originating from rural communities within Morocco itself. This underscores the city's ongoing efforts to provide housing and opportunities for its own marginalized population, reflecting Casablanca's role as a hub for socioeconomic development within the country.</p>
