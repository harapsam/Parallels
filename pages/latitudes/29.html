      <p>Our journey northward brings us just above the 29th parallel, where we encounter a land that has been inhabited for centuries despite its challenging climate. It sits on the outskirts of a harsh yet alluring desert. The Draa Valley, tracing the natural course of the Oued Draa, offers extensive arable land. This has played a pivotal role in the historical and economic development of the region.</p>
      <br>
      <p>For ages, the Oued Draa experienced seasonal water fluctuations in line with the changing weather patterns, akin to the Nile in Egypt. However, in 1972, the Eddahbi Mansour Dam was constructed near the town of Ouarzazate, followed by two downstream release dams. These structures were built to exert better control over the water flow, enabling more precise irrigation practices. What could be a more effective means of nurturing both agricultural and economic growth than harnessing the power of water?</p>

      <p>The construction of the Eddahbi Mansour Dam has led to a noteworthy expansion of six downstream oases: Mezguita, Tinzouline, Ternata, Fezouata, Ktaoua, and M'Hamid El Ghizlane. This significant transformation in the landscape has been closely monitored through NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) analysis, conducted via remote sensing of the region. This analysis has been carried out at 16-day intervals since the dam's completion in 1972, offering valuable insights into the changes in vegetation cover.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Surprisingly, the NDVI analysis reveals that the quantity of vegetation, as measured by the reflected near-infrared and absorbed red light, has remained relatively consistent over the past half a century. This stability in vegetation might initially appear promising, particularly in a region that grapples with the ever-looming threat of desertification driven by climate change.  However, delving deeper into the data paints a more concerning picture. Despite the seemingly unaltered vegetation cover, this phenomenon warrants closer examination and scrutiny.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>The Draa Valley is the largest oasis in Morocco and encompases a third of all oasis landcover, second largest in the entire Sahara after the Nile.</p>

    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>To begin, let's delve into the changes in population over the past few decades within the context of Morocco. While the population in these oases has declines, in some cases drastically, when viewed in the broader context of Morocco's overall population growth, this raises some concerns. Since the year 2000, Morocco has experienced a substantial 22% increase in its population. However, the population of these oases has either remained relatively the same or exhibited a decrease.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The stark reality is that the region has not witnessed the same population growth as the rest of the country. In fact, these oases have witnessed a decrease of approximately 10% in their overall number of households during this period. This trend is further compounded by the demographic dynamics at play. Older generations tend to stay rooted in their villages, while young individuals often migrate to urban centers in search of educational and employment opportunities. This migration pattern leaves a substantial portion of the strenuous labor and field work to be shouldered by the middle-aged and elderly population, which poses additional challenges to the sustainability of these communities.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The following two graphs illustrate the demographic changes that have transpired in recent decades. The initial graph illustrates the population fluctuations in the two primary palm groves designated for habitation, Ktaoua and M'Hamid. Over the course of forty years, both of these regions have witnessed a significant decrease in their resident populations.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The second graph displays the population changes across all six oases between the last two national censuses. Within these areas, population trends have varied, with some experiencing modest increases while others have undergone significant declines.  There has been a complete collapse of the population in Ternata.</p>

    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>Another concerning trend revolves around the changes in the primary water source essential for sustaining the agrarian life within these oases. When the Eddahbi Mansour Dam was initially constructed, it was designed to provide downstream areas with water through a carefully orchestrated system of dam releases, averaging around five per year. This reliable water supply, stemming from the expansive Eddahbi Mansour water retention area, often referred to as the Eddahbi Mansour Lake, has been a lifeline for the oases. There were instances, depending on seasonal rainfall, when the number of dam releases exceeded even ten per year.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Nevertheless, a significant shift occurred in the early 2010s. The number of dam releases was capped at four per year, and, more alarmingly, over the past five years, it has been further restricted to a mere two releases annually. This reduction in water releases is severely inadequate for sustaining both crop irrigation and the drinking water needs of the communities downstream. This troubling development has brought into sharp focus the growing challenge of maintaining the traditional agricultural practices and livelihoods in the region.</p>

  <div class="row-overview">
    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>As the frequency of dam releases has diminished, the oasis communities have found themselves increasingly dependent on groundwater sourced from the underlying aquifers for both drinking water and, in certain cases, irrigation. This shift in reliance on groundwater has given rise to two significant adverse consequences.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Firstly, the sustained extraction of groundwater for these essential purposes has led to the gradual depletion of available groundwater resources. Over time, this continuous withdrawal has strained the aquifers, reducing their water levels and, consequently, the overall availability of this vital resource.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Secondly, the overreliance on groundwater has exacerbated another critical issue: the salinification of the groundwater itself. As the withdrawn groundwater is used to replace the water taken from the aquifers, the concentration of salts and minerals within the aquifers gradually increases. This process of salinification renders the groundwater less suitable for both drinking and irrigation, as elevated salt levels can be harmful to crops and make the water less potable.</p>
      <br>
      <p>These twin challenges of depleting groundwater reserves and the increasing salinification of available water sources further compound the sustainability issues facing these oasis communities.</p>

      <p>An examination of the publicly available data provided by the Moroccan government unveils a narrative that resonates with trends witnessed in many regions—it's the quintessential tale of urban-to-rural migration. To gain a deeper understanding, we can scrutinize the construction data encompassing the entire country. This data reveals a marked decrease in new housing construction in 2018, primarily in response to the housing crisis, which we will explore further as we progress towards the higher latitudes.</p>
      <br>
      <p>What piques our interest here is the distinct pattern observed in the Draa region. Unlike the substantial drop in new constructions experienced in major urban centers such as Marrakech, Casablanca, and Tangiers, the Draa region exhibited only a minor decline in new construction activities. This unique trajectory within the Draa region, amidst the broader national context, merits further investigation, shedding light on the evolving dynamics of urban and rural areas in Morocco and hinting at potential factors contributing to this divergence.</p>

      <p>In the wake of the construction slump experienced in 2018, the nationwide data on concrete usage underwent a notable reduction, with one noteworthy exception—the Draa region. When we closely examine the statistics, a rather intriguing pattern emerges: the Draa region stands as the sole geographical area in the entire country that has witnessed a consistent increase in concrete consumption since 2018.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This exceptional trend sparks curiosity and prompts a deeper exploration into the underlying factors driving this divergence from the national norm. It raises questions about the economic, infrastructural, or developmental dynamics at play within the Draa region, which appear to set it apart from the broader trends observed across Morocco. Understanding the reasons behind this distinct pattern may offer valuable insights into the region's unique trajectory in the realm of construction and development.</p>

      <p>What adds an intriguing layer to this narrative is the nature of the construction projects themselves. Across much of the country, particularly in urban centers, the aftermath of the 2018 housing crisis led to a pronounced shift towards the construction of low-income housing units, often intended to accommodate internally displaced individuals. However, within the Draa Valley, a significant proportion of the new constructions takes a decidedly different direction—they manifest as luxury housing developments.</p>
      <br>
      <p>These luxury housing projects are primarily initiated by individuals who once hailed from the oasis community but ventured elsewhere in pursuit of opportunities. Having found success in their endeavors, they return to their roots and invest their earnings in building lavish residences within their home community. This phenomenon underscores their deep-rooted connection to the Draa Valley and the need to stay connected with their community.</p>
      <br>
      <p>To gain a clearer perspective on this intriguing trend, we can refer to the accompanying graph, which illustrates the proportion of new constructions categorized as luxury housing in the region. This data serves as a visual representation of the unique dynamics at play within the Draa Valley, where investment in luxury housing stands out as a distinctive and noteworthy pattern amidst the broader national trends of migration and construction.</p>

      <p>We've observed how the Moroccan government, in collaboration with French agro-business interests and <em>Les Domaines agricoles</em>, has embarked on a strategic endeavor to diversify Morocco's agricultural exports. This diversification strategy has focused on the cultivation of fruits and vegetables destined for European markets, capitalizing on Morocco's extended growing season compared to many European countries. Within this broader agricultural diversification effort, particular attention has been directed towards the research and development of tomato and blueberry production.</p>
      <br>
      <p>However, when we scrutinize the list of the top ten exporting countries for blueberries and tomatoes and assess the ratio of fruit production to available arable land, a revealing pattern emerges. It becomes evident that Morocco is straining its natural water resources in order to maintain its prominent position in these export markets. The ratio, in this context, serves as an indicator of how efficiently arable land is utilized for fruit production. A lower ratio, such as what we observe in Morocco's case, implies that it requires a substantial degree of creativity and resourcefulness to achieve high export yields on relatively limited arable land.</p>

      <p>This insight underscores the challenges and trade-offs inherent in Morocco's ambitious agricultural export strategy. While it has successfully expanded its presence in European markets, the strain on water resources raises concerns about the long-term sustainability of these practices. Achieving high export volumes under such conditions necessitates innovative and sustainable water management solutions to safeguard both Morocco's position in these markets and its precious natural resources.  To note, the Netherlands also stands out due to its small crop-to-land ratio. The main difference is that the Netherlands is more suitable for growing water-intensive crops than the arid climate of Morocco. In addition, Spain has a ratio similar to Morocco's; however, Morocco exports considerably more blueberries and tomatoes than Spain. The difference lies in a substantial tonnage, which is not negligible.</p>

      <p>In an even more peculiar twist, Morocco has caught onto the avocado craze, with avocados being hailed as a superfood that caters to the health-conscious consumers of Europe. As a result, the production of avocados for export in the country has experienced an astonishing surge in recent years, as visually depicted in the graph below.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This unanticipated shift in the agricultural landscape reflects the adaptability and responsiveness of Moroccan agriculture to evolving global consumer preferences. The rising demand for avocados, often associated with their health benefits and versatility in various cuisines, has prompted Moroccan growers to seize this opportunity. The graph serves as a visual testament to the remarkable growth in avocado production, signaling Morocco's ability to diversify its agricultural exports and tap into emerging trends in the global food market.</p>

      <br>
      <img src="../../images/29/advocado.png" width="100%">

    <div class="column-overview">
      <p>While Morocco's foray into avocado production aligns with its agricultural aspirations, it raises significant concerns about the sustainability of this endeavor. The chart below illustrates the varying water requirements of different crops, shedding light on the predicament facing Morocco.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Over the past half-century, Morocco has transitioned away from traditional crops likes olives, nuts and argan trees that demand less water, and in some cases, exhibit drought resistance. Instead, there has been a notable shift towards the cultivation of water-intensive crops. This shift is driven, in part, by the prolonged growing season facilitated by the region's consistent warm and sunny weather. However, this change in crop production patterns places additional stress on an already overburdened water supply.</p>
      <br>
      <p>A glaring example of this shift is evident in the Draa Valley, where the predominant crop is watermelon—a crop known for its substantial water requirements. This shift towards water-intensive crops, while potentially profitable in the short term, presents a long-term challenge as it exacerbates the strain on Morocco's finite water resources. It underscores the pressing need for innovative and sustainable agricultural practices that can strike a balance between economic goals and responsible water management in this arid region.</p>

          <p>That is not to say that efforts to continue and even to revive traditional agriculture do not exist.  Traditional agriculture, particularly in indigenous communities, often relies on crops that are well-suited to the local semi-arid environment. These crops have evolved to be drought-resistant, which is advantageous in areas with limited water resources. However, the challenge arises from the fact that yields of traditional crops are affected by even the slightest variations in weather patterns between growing seasons, which are unavoidable in such a climate.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Low and variable crop yields have economic consequences. The instability in production makes it difficult for farmers to plan and invest in their agricultural activities. Additionally, lower yields can lead to decreased income and food insecurity for the communities relying on these crops.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In the context of the neoliberal push for resource control, there is often pressure to maximize economic efficiency in agriculture. Traditional agriculture, due to its vulnerability and variability, may not align with the profit-driven goals of neoliberal policies. Therefore, investments in traditional agriculture may be perceived as less economically beneficial and less politically sustainable, especially when compared to more modern, market-oriented approaches, like avocados. </p>

        <div class="column-overview">
          <p>The two graphs presented here illustrate the precarious nature of almond production. The first graph depicts almond production in terms of tonnage. Despite a focused effort to bolster agricultural exports, the growth in almond production is relatively sluggish and minimal when compared to the remarkable expansion experienced by the blueberry, tomato, and avocado industries.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The second graph displays the annual variations in almond yield from 1980 to 2021. The red bars in the graph represent a notable decrease in production attributed to extreme climatic changes during specific growing seasons. This data underscores that traditional crops, like almonds, which rely on large land areas, do not offer the yield per hectare that attracts agribusiness conglomerates.  Traditional crops are abandoned to make room for fruits and vegetables with higher profit margins.</p>
